# todo
A todo list in every language

-----------------------------------------------------
--- python ---
Just using the console currently. 
Improvements:
    editing tasks (basically just del -> add tbh).
    mark tasks completed.
    sorting tasks (alpahbetically is silly, but allowing user to rearrange might be nice).
    adding due dates
-----------------------------------------------------

--- java ---
Imporvements:
    saving tasks to a file for persistent memory
    more sophisticated error handling
    displays all tasks differently (using [Completed] & [Not Complete] is kinda ugly tbh).
    task edits
    due dates 


-----------------------------------------------------
--- javascript ---
Imporvements:
    persistence using localStorage
    task edits
    due dates
